# SecureFileTransfer---Java

This project implements a secure client-server file transfer system in Java using public key cryptography (RSA) and symmetric key encryption (AES). It includes practical application of cryptographic concepts using the Java Cryptography API.

It demonstrates:
- End-to-end encryption
- Mutual authentication using RSA keys and digital signatures
- Secure symmetric key exchange and AES encryption in CBC mode
- Implementation of cryptographic protocols from scratch using Java's standard libraries
